## 🚀 Features

- **Θ(N) Time Complexity** – Processes upto 400 million planks in **under 4 seconds**.
- **Stack-Safe** – No recursion, avoids stack overflows.
- **Optimal Strokes** – Correctly minimizes vertical/horizontal brush strokes just like the known approaches.

---

## 📜 Problem Statement

Given `N` vertical planks of varying heights, determine the **minimum number of brush strokes** required to paint the entire fence.  
**Allowed Moves**:  
- Paint a horizontal stroke across consecutive planks at the same height.  
- Paint a vertical stroke on a single plank.

## 🛠️ Solution 

- Included with the known O(N²) and O(N log N) solutions, along with automatically generated tests to compare performance under different scenarios.
- Explained in-depth (w/ examples) in the [slides (English)]() accompanied by a [video (Arabic)]().
