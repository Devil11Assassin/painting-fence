## 🚀 Features

- **O(N) Time Complexity** – Processes upto 400 million planks in **under 4 seconds**.
- **Stack-Safe** – No recursion, avoids stack overflows.
- **Optimal Strokes** – Correctly minimizes vertical/horizontal brush strokes just like the known approaches.

---

## 📜 Problem Statement

Given `N` vertical planks of varying heights, determine the **minimum number of brush strokes** required to paint the entire fence.  
**Allowed Moves**:  
- Paint a horizontal stroke across consecutive planks at the same height.  
- Paint a vertical stroke on a single plank.
